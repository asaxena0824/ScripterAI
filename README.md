# ScripterAI

<i> This doc is not complete. Please bear with us as we work toward making it completed. </i>

## Introduction

ScripterAI is an AI powered build tool for gaming engines such as Roblox, Unreal, and Unity. Its primary purpose is to generate simple scripts using natural language prompts. We offer free access to GPT-4, Copilot, and a code-engineered version of ChatGPT (plus). We welcome any other suggestions or ideas you may have too. We also record high-quality generations and provide them in a free searchable and easy to use library.

## Best Practices

* Refer to our [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@haddockai) for getting a better idea of the tool usage. 
* Remember to be specific and clear in your prompt, you do not need to specify that you're requesting something for ```Roblox``` as ScripterAI is trained to work with Roblox by default.
  * ```Script for a Zombie spawner in Roblox``` ‚ùå
  * ```Make a zombie spwnwer``` or ```create a zombie spawner``` or ```script for a zombie spawner``` :white_check_mark:
* ScripterAI is not capable of creating entire games by commands. For example, commands like ```create this RP game for me``` will probably not work. Instead, you must be specific about what you want, if it is a ```quest``` then you can ask the ScripterAI to create functions for that ```quest```.
* To make multiple functions work through a single prompt, remember to separate the instructions by a `delimiter`.
* Do not overengineer the prompt, keep it simple but specific. 

## Main Pro Tips

* Use tick mark to indicate that the scripts are correct. By using your feedback as training data, we aim to create the single largest fine-tuned model for Roblox.
* You can ask ScripterAI to add comments to the code by appending 'add comments to code' to your request.
* If you are not satisfied with the results, you can keep clicking on 'Generate' again to regenerate the response until you get what you're looking for. Albeit, each click will be a considered a call.

## Haddock Library 
* Library Mode is a free search engine for scripts generated by ScripterAI. Although there is a limited number of scripts accessible at this point, the library is expected to grow by 30-50 scripts every week. If a script has not been generated by ScripterAI, it will clearly say so at the top.

## Tech Stack 

* `Node.js` for backend.
* `MongoDB` for data storage.
* `Bootstrap` and `Angular` for frontend.
* `CodeMirror` for the code editor.
